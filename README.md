Creating a plugin isn't difficult. Here you will build a basic Hello World plugin in 4 stages, each building on the previous stage.

	- Stage 1 - Display the text “Hello World” in the plugin space
	- Stage 2
	- Stage 3
	- Stage 4

First, create a project folder and inside of it create a file called package.json. This plugin will need just two node modules, gem and proto. In the terminal go into the project folder and install the two gems. This will add the gems to the package.json file and create a node modules folder with the gems inside of it.
